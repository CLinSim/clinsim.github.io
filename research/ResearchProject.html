<h1>Research Projects of C. Lin</h1>

<p>
    My research focuses on understanding heterogeneous catalysis through in silico approaches, exploring both catalysts and reaction environments. The intricate relationship between catalysts and their surroundings presents persistent challenges in catalyst design and reaction optimization. Given the complexity at the heterogeneous interface, direct experimental observation of the reaction process and its dynamic changes can be elusive. However, computational simulations serve as a robust tool to investigate these mechanisms and uncover the synergistic effects between the catalyst and the environment.
</p>
<p>
    Linking microscopic phenomena to macroscale observation requires understanding reaction thermodynamics and kinetics across multiple time and space scales. My research methods include Density Functional Theory computation, microkinetic modeling, Monte Carlo simulation, and continuum models for transport simulation.
</p>
<p>
    Here are my current and past research projects. The latest project is exhibited first.

<h2>Year 2024: Methyl cyclohexane dehydrogenation catalyst design via machine learning</h2>
    
<div class="project-summary">

    <p>
<b>Research background:</b> This project is to design a catalyst for methyl cyclohexane (MCH) dehydrogenation using computational chemistry. Previous catalysts, such as Pt nanoclusters, have strong interactions with TOL, leading to the formation of side products like benzene and methane, which increases the cost of product separation and coke formation due to the accumulation of aromatic adsorbates. Therefore, we decided to search for a bimetallic nanocluster catalyst that reduces toluene adsorption and improves MCH dehydrogenation reactivity through high-throughput catalyst screening. But computational catalyst screening for heterogeneous reactions involving large adsorbates and low-symmetry sites is challenging due to the complexity of the molecule-site interaction and the cost of collecting enough training data. 
    </p>
    <p>
<b>Main conclusions:</b> Using inputs to a Gaussian process regression model inspired by physical theories of chemisorption, we predict the adsorption energies of large hydrocarbon intermediates encountered during methyl cyclohexane dehydrogenation. Across bimetallic active sites of nanoclusters with varied shapes and compositions, our model yields mean absolute errors of 0.11 â€“ 0.25 eV on test sets and utilizes under 100 data points per reaction intermediate. This model is integrated with a microkinetic model to identify promising catalysts. Modifying Pt nanoclusters with IB, IIB, and post-transition elements like Cu and Sn increases dehydrogenation rates, reduces unselective reactions, and lowers Pt utilization, consistent with prior experiments. This work presents a scalable and efficient framework for designing bimetallic catalysts for dehydrogenating hydrogen carriers.

<h2>Year 2023: Solvent effect discoverred for plasmon-enhanced hydrogen evolution reaction</h2>
    
<div class="project-summary">
    <img src="RP2023_01_PEEC HER.png" alt="Project Summary Image">
    <p>
<b>Research background:</b> Plasmon-enhanced electrochemistry (PEEC) has been observed to facilitate electrochemical reactions by converting light energy to chemical energy. However, even though the PEEC effect was observed to be solvent-dependent, the mechanism of how plasmon affects the liquid environment of an electrochemical reaction was unknown. Using ensemble-based methodologies on macroscopic electrodes fails to measure electron-transfer kinetics due to constraints from mass transport and the averaging effect. 
    </p>
    <p>
<b>Main conclusions:</b> We have employed nanoparticle impact electrochemistry (NIE), a newly developed electroanalytical technique capable of measuring electrochemical dynamics at a single-nanoparticle level under optimal mass transport conditions, along with microscopic electron-transfer theory for data interpretation. By investigating the plasmon enhanced hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at individual silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), we have clearly revealed the previously unknown influence of solvent effects within the PEEC mechanism. This finding suggests an additional approach to optimize plasmon-assisted electrocatalysis and electrosynthesis systems.

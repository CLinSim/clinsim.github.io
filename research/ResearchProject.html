  <h1>Research Projects of C. Lin</h1>
  <p>I otained PhD from University of Oxford in 2017. My PhD research focused on the non-catalytic factors that affecting the electrocatalytic reactions. This may sound a little bit funny but it is truely a long-lasting topic in catalysis. There has been researches that can be traced back to decades ago where scientists explored the influence of non-catalytic factors such as mass transport, solvent, electrical double layer, et al on electrochemical results. This field becomes popolar again in recent years.... </p>

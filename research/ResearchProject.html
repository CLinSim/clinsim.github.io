  <p style="font-family:sans-serif;font-size:150%;">My research focuses on understanding heterogeneous catalysis through in silico approaches, exploring both catalysts and reaction environments. The intricate relationship between catalysts and their surroundings presents persistent challenges in catalyst design and reaction optimization. Given the complexity at the heterogeneous interface, direct experimental observation of the reaction process and its dynamic changes can be elusive. However, computational simulations serve as a robust tool to investigate these mechanisms and uncover the synergistic effects between the catalyst and the environment. Through multiscale kinetics simulations, spanning from first-principles computations to continuum modeling, we have identified the impact of mass transport on the reactivity and selectivity of electrocatalytic reactions, elucidated complex reaction mechanisms across various electrocatalytic systems, devised optimization strategies using fluidized nanoparticles, and enabled the design of dehydrogenation reaction catalysts through high-throughput screening methods.</p>
